Hi, Welcome to Foresight X OpenBuild HackerHouse HK, Here are some guides for you.

## How do you push your delivery?

First, please fork this repository and clone it to your local workspace, go to the `Workshop_Delivery` folder, and then please submit your deliverables to the corresponding folders according to the workshop you are participating in and the instructor's requirements (We have preset folders for each workshop according to the workshop name).
If you deliver more than one file, please create a folder for it, and name it using this format (single file also use this):

> DeliveryName_of_YourName

Finally, **please submit your changes to us by Pull Request**, and we will review these PRs with the instructor together.

You can find a detailed guide about Github PR here: [How to PR on GitHub](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)
